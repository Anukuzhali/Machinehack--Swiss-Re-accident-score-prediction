### Predict accident risk score for unique postcode

According to IBEF “Domestic automobiles production increased at 2.36% CAGR between FY16-20 with 26.36 million vehicles being manufactured in the country in FY20.Overall, domestic automobiles sales increased at 1.29% CAGR between FY16-FY20 with 21.55 million vehicles being sold in FY20”.The rise in vehicles on the road will also lead to multiple challenges and the road will be more vulnerable to accidents.Increased accident rates also leads to more insurance claims and payouts rise for insurance companies.

In order to pre-emptively plan for the losses, the insurance firms leverage accident data to understand the risk across the geographical units e.g. Postal code/district etc.

In this challenge, we are providing you the dataset to predict the “Accident_Risk_Index” against the postcodes.Accident_Risk_Index (mean casualties at a postcode) = sum(Number_of_casualities)/count(Accident_ID)

The participants are required to predict the 'Accident_risk_index' for the test.csv and against the postcode on the test data.

In this competition I was able to get 49th rank
